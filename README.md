Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm SÃ©bastien, a freelance developer living near Paris, specialized in **React** and **React-Native**.

I've been a **React early-adopter**, since **January 2014**[*](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21352468/82609).

I am the author of **[ThisWeekInReact.com](https://thisweekinreact.com)**, the best newsletter to stay up-to-date with the React ecosystem:

Iâ€™m currently working on [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus), a React-based static site generator with a focus on documentation, as a contractor for Facebook.

I like:
- remote work: since 2014
- flexibility and trust: I work for people that care about outcomes
- interesting projects: I choose carefully, to keep learning
- part-time: working on multiple projects gives a diverse experience
- consulting, coaching, training, audits: the best ROI for my customers, and a higher rate for me

I chose a different path than most French contractors (on-site, full-time, multi-years contracts).

Previously, I was a Java/Scala developer for a few years, and I didn't like JavaScript much :)
