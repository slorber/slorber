Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm SÃ©bastien, a freelance developer living near Paris, specialized in **React** and **React-Native**.

I've been a **React early-adopter**, since **January 2014**[*](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21352468/82609). 

Iâ€™m currently working on [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus), a React-based static site generator with a focus on documentation, as a contractor for Facebook.

I like:
- remote work: since 2014
- flexibility and trust: I work for people that care about outcomes
- interesting projects: I choose carefully, to keep learning
- part-time: working on multiple projects gives a diverse experience
- consulting, coaching, training, audits: the best ROI for my customers, and a higher rate for me

I chose a different path than most French contractors (on-site, full-time, multi-years contracts).

Previously, I was a Java/Scala developer for a few years, and I didn't like JavaScript much :)


# Content creation

Despite a large experience of the whole React ecosystem, I didn't produce much content between 2014 and 2019.

Lately, I'm trying to write more, and to follow the Learn In Public mantra. 

Unusual, but the platform I focus on the most is [LinkedIn](https://sebastienlorber.com/linkedin): I write almost daily about React related stuff, in french, since summer 2019, with great success. It helped me bootstrap [ReactHebdo.fr](http://reacthebdo.fr), my weekly React curation newsletter.

I'm also trying to find a good workflow to produce more detailed blog posts, and content in english, to reach a broader audience.

I have a lot of things to share, and a large backlog of things I want to write about. The only problem is time :)
